# FeetToCentimetersConverter

My friend wanted to convert feet into smaller measurements, but when you try to put 5'10 as 5.10, a computer will typically think you're putting 5.1, and if you try to put 5'11 as 5.11, you end up with a result just slightly bigger than the prior one thats _10_ inches less.

This converter takes in specifically feet measurements (1'0, 2'4, etc.) and converts them. Different branches may have different measurements ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
(oh and just putting the feet in like '5' works perfectly fine too)
