# FeetToCentimetersConverter

My friend wanted to convert feet into smaller measurements, but when you try to put 5'10 as 5.10, a computer will typically think you're putting 5.1, as in 5'1.something.

This converter takes in specifically feet measurements (1'0, 2'4, etc.) and converts them. Different branches may have different measurements ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
